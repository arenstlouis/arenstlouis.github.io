			<p> Hi! My name is Aren St. Louis. I am currently a junior at the beautiful Luther College </p>
			<p>and started taking Computer Science classes in the spring of 2014 </p>
			<p>I originally took them for fun but discovered I really liked them, so I decided to declare CS as my major. </p>
			<p>I play tuba in the Wind and Percussion Ensemble at Luther </p>
			<p>This is the first web page I have ever created </p>
