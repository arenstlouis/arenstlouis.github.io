		<h1> Welcome to the home page of Aren St. Louis </h1>
		<p> Hi! My name is Aren St. Louis. I am currently a junior at the beautiful Luther College </p>
		<p> <img src= "http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/img/college-photo_352._445x280-zmm.jpg" </img> and started taking Computer Science classes in the spring of 2014 </p>
		<p>I originally took them for fun but discovered I really liked them, so I decided to declare CS as my major. </p>
		<p>I play tuba in the Wind and Percussion Ensemble at Luther </p>
		<p>This is the first web page I have ever created </p>
		<p>  <a href = TEMPTEMPTEMP> Here </a> is some more information about me </p>
